# personal-portfolio

This git repo is for my personal portfolio website, which is built with HTML, Sass and JavaScript. 

It is a fully mobile-responsive website and javascript fade-in animations has been impelmented.

You can also find links to my email, LinkedIn and GitHub on my website and send me an email by a form located at the bottom of the page!

I will continuously update this website! Thanks for stopping by!
